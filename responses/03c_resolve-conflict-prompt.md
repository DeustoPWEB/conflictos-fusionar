## Step 7: Resolve conflicts you created

Good job! By making commits on two branches, you've created a history just like you saw in your previous conflict.

![deviated branches](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13326548/36703541-ef3c48f8-1b10-11e8-899f-bbaaf5927d24.png)

Typically, this happens when someone else merges a branch into `master` that has commits in the same files you've been working on.

### :keyboard: Activity: Resolve the conflict

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}
1. Resolve the conflicts locally by checking out to this branch and repeating your previous steps.
{% else %}
1. In the "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved" section of the pull request, click **Resolve conflicts**.
{% endif %}

Because you created both conflicts, feel free to resolve these conflicts as you wish.
