Yay! You've done it! You've resolved all of the conflicts.

More complicated merge conflicts need to be resolved on the command line. We won't resolve these types of conflicts in this course, but when you do, you might encounter:
- Modifications to a file that's been deleted on another branch
- Significant file changes between two branches that are different enough that Git will treat them as different files
- GUI resolution tools

For help with these more complicated merge conflicts, you can schedule a consultation with GitHub Services via [services.github.com](https://services.github.com/).
