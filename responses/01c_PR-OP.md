## Step 2: Merge the pull request

Great work, @{{ user.username }}! You've created your first pull request successfully, and so far, there are no conflicts.

... but what actually is a pull request?  

A pull request is a proposal to **merge** your changes with the code on the base branch, usually `master`.

Back to our visualization. When you opened your pull request, your Git <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#git)</sup> history looked like this:

Your pull request simply indicates that you want to apply the history of your branch (in this case `{{ branch }}`), into the `master` branch.

That merge _might_ look something like this:
