Before I say good-bye, here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- You practiced a normal merge
- You resolved a simple merge conflict
- You created a merge conflict, and resolved it!
- You resolved a multi-file merge conflict
- You enabled GitHub Pages

## What's next?

I've opened two more optional issues if you want to keep working on your resumé:
- [Changes to projects]({{issue1}})
- [Change picture]({{issue2}})
