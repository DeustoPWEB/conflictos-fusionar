## Step 5b: Merging similar changes

Good job! Remember from the last issue that your history now looks something like this, without conflicts:

![branch commits](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13326548/36703529-e1458976-1b10-11e8-97cb-ae4c2361bd20.png)

However, in a real world scenario, it's possible that a peer or colleague will have edited the same file in the same place as your pull request.

To demonstrate, I'll stand in as your colleague :wave:. In Pull Request {{ secondPR }}, you'll see that the education file has been changed. If the other pull request is merged to `master` first, you will see a conflict in your pull request. Let's try it now.

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge "Another User's Change"

1. Click on {{ secondPR }}
1. Follow the instructions in that pull request to approve it
